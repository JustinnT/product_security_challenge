# Zendesk Product Security
## Setting up
Platform: Ubuntu 18.04 (Or any Linux based platform)
1. Ensure that nodejs and npm are installed on the machine 
2. Clone the repository onto the machine
3. Navigate to /project folder
4. Locate and unzip rockyou.zip in the same folder
5. (Optional) Locate the file `ca.crt` in the /cert folder
6. (Optional) Add `ca.crt` as a trusted root certificate in your preferred browser (Mozilla Firefox etc.)
6. Open the terminal in the folder and run `npm i`
7. In the same terminal, run `npm start`
8. Visit https://localhost:3443 

## List of mechanisms implemented
1. Input sanitization and validation\
Basic validation to ensure that usernames or emails are not repeated
2. Password hashed\
bcrypt was used to hash and store the password. 10 rounds of salt was used.
3. Prevention of timing attacks\
Implemented by bcrypt, the bcrypt comparison function is not susceptible to timing attacks
4. Logging\
Currently not implemented
5. CSRF prevention\
Currently not implemented
6. Multi factor authentication\
Currently not implemented
7. Password reset / forget password mechanism\
Currently not implemented
8. Account lockout\
Currently not implemented
9. Cookie\
express-session and passportjs was used for authentication and user sessions.
10. HTTPS\
Implemented with a self-signed certificate
11. Known password check\
Registered passwords are checked against the rockyou.txt list. Any passwords in the list are rejected

## Reflection and future work
I would like to thank the zendesk team for this challenge and extending this opportunity to me. I learnt a lot and had fun doing this challenge despite the busy week. Unfortuneately I was unable to fully implement the list and I'm a little disappointed in myself
but nevertheless I still enjoyed this learning process. One of my main weakness was definitely time prioritization as I was stuck in implementing one of the features, and in addition school work, which resulted in the short list of mechanisms implemented. 
I will take note of this in future by ensuring enough time for my projects as well as seeking help when needed.

With the deadline over, I plan to slowly work on the remaining functionalities. On first glance, some functionalities like account lockout looks simple. However, other features like MFA and password reset seems complicated. However I am intrigured by how it works 
and I'll continue to work on this project on a separate branch (https://github.com/JustinnT/product_security_challenge/tree/add_features). 

As a self note, in order of importance, I plan to work on these few features:
1. Account lockout (Perhaps add a counter along with user credentials, after 5 tries it will lock the account and send a notification e-mail to the registered e-mail address. Also can record IP geolocation such that when a login is made with a different location, can send notification to registered e-mail.)
2. Password reset (Also can include a reset function for lost QR authenticators for MFA)
3. Input sanitization (Set minimum password length/strength, as well as validating inputs to prevent SQL injections when the database is up. Can also include a dynamic password strength check on client side.)
4. MFA (Using speakeasy, QR based 2FA authentication.)
5. Logging and CSRF (Apparently passportJS offers CSRF functionalities, will have to research more on how to enable it)
6. Setting up a database to store user credentials (mongoDB)

Once again thank you zendesk for extending this opportunity to me!

### The Zendesk Product Security Challenge

Hello friend,

We are super excited that you want to be part of the Product Security team at Zendesk.

**To get started, you need to fork this repository to your own Github profile and work off that copy.**

In this repository, there are the following files:
1. README.md - this file
2. project/ - the folder containing all the files that you require to get started
3. project/index.html - the main HTML file containing the login form
4. project/assets/ - the folder containing supporting assets such as images, JavaScript files, Cascading Style Sheets, etc. You shouldnâ€™t need to make any changes to these but you are free to do so if you feel it might help your submission

As part of the challenge, you need to implement an authentication mechanism with as many of the following features as possible. It is a non exhaustive list, so feel free to add or remove any of it as deemed necessary.

1. Input sanitization and validation
2. Password hashed
3. Prevention of timing attacks
4. Logging
5. CSRF prevention
6. Multi factor authentication
7. Password reset / forget password mechanism
8. Account lockout
9. Cookie
10. HTTPS
11. Known password check

You will have to create a simple binary (platform of your choice) to provide any server side functionality you may require. Please document steps to run the application. Your submission should be a link to your Github repository which you've already forked earlier together with the source code and binaries.

Thank you!
